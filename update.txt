✅ What is UPDATE Command?

👉 UPDATE is used to modify existing data inside a table.

⚠️ It does NOT change table structure (like ALTER).
It changes data (rows/records).

🧠 Syntax
UPDATE table_name
SET column_name = value
WHERE condition;


👉 SET → what to change
👉 WHERE → which row to change

⚠️ If you forget WHERE, all rows will be updated.

🔷 Example Table: students
id	name	age	city
1	Ravi	20	Mumbai
2	Priya	21	Delhi
3	John	19	Chennai
🔷 1️⃣ Update Single Column
UPDATE students
SET city = 'Pune'
WHERE id = 1;


👉 Ravi’s city becomes Pune.

🔷 2️⃣ Update Multiple Columns
UPDATE students
SET age = 22,
    city = 'Bangalore'
WHERE id = 2;


👉 Priya’s age and city updated.

🔷 3️⃣ Update Without WHERE (Very Dangerous ⚠️)
UPDATE students
SET city = 'India';


👉 All students' city becomes India.

🔷 4️⃣ Update Using Condition
UPDATE students
SET age = 25
WHERE city = 'Chennai';


👉 Only students from Chennai get age = 25.

🔷 5️⃣ Update Using Expression
UPDATE students
SET age = age + 1;


👉 Increase age of all students by 1.

🔷 6️⃣ Update Using Another Table

Example: Give bonus to employees based on department.

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + 5000
FROM departments
WHERE employees.dept_id = departments.id
AND departments.name = 'IT';


👉 IT department employees get salary increase.
