Return the lowest price in the products table:

SELECT MIN(price)
FROM products;
-------------------

Set Column Name
When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will be named min or max by default. To give the column a new name, use the AS keyword.

Example
Return the lowest price, and name the column lowest_price:

SELECT MIN(price) AS lowest_price
FROM products;

------------------------

COUNT
The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.

If the specified criterion is a column name, the COUNT() function returns the number of columns with that name.

-------------------------------

Example
Return the number of customers from the customers table:

SELECT COUNT(customer_id)
FROM customers;

-----------------------


By specifying a WHERE clause, you can e.g. return the number of customers that comes from London:

Example
Return the number of customers from London:

SELECT COUNT(customer_id)
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'London';


------------------------

With 2 Decimals
The above example returned the average price of all products, the result was 28.8663636363636364.

We can use the ::NUMERIC operator to round the average price to a number with 2 decimals:

Example
Return the average price of all the products, rounded to 2 decimals:

SELECT AVG(price)::NUMERIC(10,2)
FROM products;


-----------------------------


Contains
To return records that contains a specific letter or phrase, add the % both before and after the letter or phrase.

Example
Return all customers with a name that contains the letter 'A':

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE customer_name LIKE '%A%';

-------------------------------------

Ends with
To return records that ends with a specific letter or phrase, add the % before the letter or phrase.

Example
Return all customers with a name that ends with the phrase 'en':

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE customer_name LIKE '%en';

----------------------------------------

IN (SELECT)
You can also use a SELECT statement inside the parenthesis to return all records that are in the result of the SELECT statement.

Example
Return all customers that have an order in the orders table:

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);

--------------------------------------------

NOT IN (SELECT)
The result in the example above returned 89 records, that means that there are 2 customers that haven't placed any orders.

Let us check if that is correct, by using the NOT IN operator.

Example
Return all customers that have NOT placed any orders in the orders table:

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);
