Sort Data
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result in ascending or descending order.

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

------------------------

Example
Sort the table by price:

SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price;

--------------------


DESC
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

Example
Sort the table by price, in descending order:

SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;

--------------------------

he OFFSET Clause
The OFFSET clause is used to specify where to start selecting the records to return.

If you want to return 20 records, but start at number 40, you can use both LIMIT and OFFSET.

Note: The first record is number 0, so when you specify OFFSET 40 it means starting at record number 41.

Example
Return 20 records, starting from the 41th record:

SELECT * FROM customers
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40;
