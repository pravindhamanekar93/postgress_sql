✅ What is DELETE Command?

👉 DELETE is used to remove existing rows (records) from a table.

⚠️ It deletes data, not table structure.

🧠 Syntax
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


👉 WHERE decides which rows to delete.

⚠️ If you forget WHERE, all rows will be deleted.

🔷 Example Table: students
id	name	age	city
1	Ravi	20	Mumbai
2	Priya	21	Delhi
3	John	19	Chennai
🔷 1️⃣ Delete Single Row
DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 1;


👉 Ravi’s record will be deleted.

🔷 2️⃣ Delete Multiple Rows
DELETE FROM students
WHERE city = 'Delhi';


👉 All students from Delhi will be deleted.

🔷 3️⃣ Delete All Rows ⚠️
DELETE FROM students;


👉 All records deleted
👉 Table still exists (only data removed)

🔷 4️⃣ DELETE with RETURNING (PostgreSQL Special ⭐)
DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 2
RETURNING *;


👉 Shows deleted row.

🔷 5️⃣ DELETE Using Another Table
DELETE FROM employees
USING departments
WHERE employees.dept_id = departments.id
AND departments.name = 'HR';


👉 Deletes employees from HR department.
