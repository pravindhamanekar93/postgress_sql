✅ What is GROUP BY Clause?

👉 GROUP BY is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns.

It is mostly used with:

COUNT()

SUM()

AVG()

MIN()

MAX()

🧠 Simple Meaning

If you want to:

Count employees department-wise

Calculate total salary department-wise

Find average marks student-wise

You use GROUP BY.

🧾 Syntax
SELECT column_name, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;

🔥 Real World Example 1 — Company
Table: employees
id	name	dept	salary
1	Ravi	IT	50000
2	Priya	IT	60000
3	John	HR	40000
4	Meena	HR	45000
5	Amit	Sales	70000

🎯 Scenario 1: Count employees in each department
SELECT dept, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;

Output:
dept	total_employees
IT	2
HR	2
Sales	1

👉 It groups rows by department.

🎯 Scenario 2: Total salary per department
SELECT dept, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;

Output:
dept	total_salary
IT	110000
HR	85000
Sales	70000
🎯 Scenario 3: Average salary per department
SELECT dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;

🔥 Real World Example 2 — E-Commerce
Table: orders
order_id	customer_id	amount
1	101	500
2	102	200
3	101	700
4	103	100
5	101	300
🎯 Find total amount spent by each customer
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

⚠️ Important Rule of GROUP BY

👉 Any column in SELECT must either:

Be inside GROUP BY
OR

Be used inside aggregate function

❌ Wrong:

SELECT name, dept, SUM(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;


👉 ERROR (because name is not grouped)

✅ Correct:

SELECT dept, SUM(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;

🔥 Multiple Columns GROUP BY
SELECT dept, salary, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept, salary;


👉 Groups by combination of dept and salary.

🧠 Execution Order (Very Important)

SQL runs in this order:

FROM

WHERE

GROUP BY

HAVING

SELECT

ORDER BY

💡 WHERE + GROUP BY Example

👉 Find total salary of IT employees only

SELECT dept, SUM(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE dept = 'IT'
GROUP BY dept;

🔥 GROUP BY vs DISTINCT
GROUP BY	DISTINCT
Used with aggregates	Removes duplicate rows
Performs grouping	Just removes duplicates
🎯 Real Corporate Use Cases

GROUP BY is used in:

Sales reports

Banking analytics

Attendance reports

Customer purchase analysis

Data dashboards

Performance metrics

🧠 Interview Questions
Q1: Can we use GROUP BY without aggregate function?

Yes ✅

SELECT dept
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;


👉 Same as DISTINCT.

Q2: Which clause runs first WHERE or GROUP BY?

👉 WHERE runs first.

🚀 Practice Question

Table: sales
