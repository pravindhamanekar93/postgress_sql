We can operate with different operators in the WHERE clause:

=	Equal to
<	Less than
>	Greater than
<=	Less than or equal to
>=	Greater than or equal to
<>	Not equal to
!=	Not equal to
LIKE	Check if a value matches a pattern (case sensitive)
ILIKE	Check if a value matches a pattern (case insensitive)
AND	Logical AND
OR	Logical OR
IN	Check if a value is between a range of values
BETWEEN	Check if a value is between a range of values
IS NULL	Check if a value is NULL
NOT	Makes a negative result e.g. NOT LIKE, NOT IN, NOT BETWEEN
-----------------------

>> AND
The logical AND operator is used when you want to check more that one condition:

Example
Return all records where the brand is 'Volvo' and the year is 1968:

SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE brand = 'Volvo' AND year = 1968;
-------------------
IN
The IN operator is used when a column's value matches any of the values in a list:

Example
Return all records where the brand is present in this list: ('Volvo', 'Mercedes', 'Ford'):

SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE brand IN ('Volvo', 'Mercedes', 'Ford');

--------------------------

BETWEEN
The BETWEEN operator is used to check if a column's value is between a specified range of values:

Example
Return all records where the year is between 1970 and 1980:

SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1980;

-----------------------------

IS NULL
The IS NULL operator is used to check if a column's value is NULL:

Example
Return all records where the model is NULL:

SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE model IS NULL;

---------------------------------------

ILIKE
Same as the LIKE operator, but ILIKE is case insensitive.

Example
Return all records where the model start with a 'm':

SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE model ILIKE 'm%';

----------------------------

NOT
The NOT operator can be used together with LIKE, ILIKE, IN, BETWEEN, and NULL operators to reverse the truth of the operator.

Example: NOT LIKE
Return all records where the brand does NOT start with a capital 'B' (case sensitive):

SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE brand NOT LIKE 'B%';

------------------------------

Return all records where the brand does NOT start with a 'b' (case insensitive):

SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE brand NOT ILIKE 'b%';

--------------------------------------
