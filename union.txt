✅ What is UNION?

👉 UNION is used to combine results of two or more SELECT queries.

It merges rows from multiple queries into one result.

🧠 Syntax
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;

⚠️ Important Rules of UNION

Number of columns must be same

Data types must be same

Column order must be same

🔷 Example 1: Basic UNION
Table: students_2023
id	name
1	Ravi
2	Priya
Table: students_2024
id	name
3	John
2	Priya
Query:
SELECT name FROM students_2023
UNION
SELECT name FROM students_2024;

Output:
name
Ravi
Priya
John

👉 Duplicate "Priya" is removed automatically.

🔷 UNION ALL (Very Important 🔥)

👉 UNION ALL keeps duplicates.

SELECT name FROM students_2023
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM students_2024;

Output:
name
Ravi
Priya
John
Priya

👉 Duplicate is NOT removed.

🧠 Difference: UNION vs UNION ALL
UNION	UNION ALL
Removes duplicates	Keeps duplicates
Slower	Faster
Uses DISTINCT internally	No duplicate checking
🔷 Example 2: With Multiple Columns
SELECT id, name FROM students_2023
UNION
SELECT id, name FROM students_2024;


👉 Both queries must have same number of columns.

🔷 Example 3: With WHERE Condition
SELECT name FROM students_2023
WHERE id > 1
UNION
SELECT name FROM students_2024
WHERE id > 2;

🔷 Example 4: Using ORDER BY
SELECT name FROM students_2023
UNION
SELECT name FROM students_2024
ORDER BY name;


👉 ORDER BY is written at the end.
